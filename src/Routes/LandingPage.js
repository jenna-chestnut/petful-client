        <h3>How it works..</h3>
        <p>Potential adopters join our queue, and can watch in real time as pets are matched up with their new owners.</p>

        <p>When you join the adoption waiting list, you'll wait until you are first in line. </p>
        <p>Once it's your turn to pick, Petful will show you two animals - a cat and dog - that have been waiting the longest for their new family. It's then up to you to choose who you'll take home. (No pressure!)</p>

        <button onClick={() => this.props.history.push('/adoption')}>Click here to adopt a pet!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
